In this project, the goal is to utilize natural language processing techniques to analyze the sentiment of news articles about Bitcoin and Ethereum and to understand other factors influencing the coins' prices. NLTK and Python will be used to tokenize text, find n-gram counts, and create word clouds for both coins. A named entity recognition model was built for both coins, and the tags were visualized using SpaCy.
